# Experiment Information

## D.1 Reason for 1 minute Interval between Runs of the Experiment

<ul>
	<li>Given that a LEO takes 90-120 minutes, we would want to conduct the experiment for at least half the orbit duration. Since the rideshare is not decided upon, we go with the higher number of 60 minutes per orbit. </li>
	<li>A finer resolution in time is preferred in general, to prevent double bit flips from occurring since our bit flip count cannot reflect double flips. </li>
	<li>However, the data budget shows that we can run up to 60 runs of the experiment per orbit. Hence, the interval between runs is decided as 1 minute.</li>
</ul>

## D.4 Flight Heritage Information about the ATMega328P 

<ul>
	<li>The ATmega328P microcontroller has flown on several CubeSats, with ArduSat-1 (2013) and ArduSat-2 (2014) being notable examples. </li>
	<li>Mitigation strategies included using software-based error correction and redundancy. </li>
	<li> The satellites operated successfully for their planned lifespans, indicating that these measures were effective for short-term missions in LEO.</li>
	<li>While the solar conditions of 2025 will be different (more intense) than the conditions of 2013, 2013 was also a time of solar peak. </li>
	<li>Our satellite is also going to be flying at LEO, for short-term, and during solar peak of Cycle 25.</li>
</ul>

 <b>We wish to send a new microcontroller to space that hasn’t flown in LEO orbit before, so that it can be tested for its radiation tolerance.</b>

However, below is the table comparing the solar conditions, for more information.

### D.5.2 The SRAM Dump
As seen below, the fixed pattern of 55 can be stored across a certain range of memory addresses. This range of memory addresses remains constant as well.
